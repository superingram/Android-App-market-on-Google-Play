# Android-App-market-on-Google-Play

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed.  The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former. The data files are as follows:

apps.csv: contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. These are the features that describe an app.
user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed, passed through a sentiment analyzer engine and tagged with its sentiment score.

This brings us to the following questions:

Which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market? <br>
Is any specific category dominating the market? <br>
Which categories have the fewest number of apps? <br>
How can we effectively come up with strategies to size and price our app? <br>
Does the size of an app affect its rating? <br>
Do users really care about system-heavy apps or do they prefer light-weighted apps? <br>
Does the price of an app affect its rating? <br>
Do users always prefer free apps over paid apps?
